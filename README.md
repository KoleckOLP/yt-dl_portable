# yt-dl_portable (Windows only, and kinda botched)

yt-dl was cumbersome to install for most people, so I've made a version that you just need to git clone and run

Current build is based on **testing** branch of **yt-dl**, which was almost ready for release before work on portable started,<br>
this means the release is postponed until everything works and portable and then check if it still works in normal way as well.

[yt-dl readme with pictures](yt-dl/readme.md) tiny bit outdated (picturing version 2.1.8)

## How to get it:

this one command downloads everything required (you only need git, Windows x64)

``git clone --recursive https://github.com/koleckolp/yt-dl_portable``

after cloning is done  you just need to run ``yt-dl_portable.bat`` (currently Windows x64 only)

icon for you shortcut is located in ``yt-dl_portable/yt-dl/gui/y.ico``
