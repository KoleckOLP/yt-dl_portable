# yt-dl_portable (Windows only, and kinda botched)

yt-dl was cumbersome to install for most people so I've made a version that you just need to git clone and run

this one command downloads everything required

git clone --recursive https://github.com/koleckolp/yt-dl_portable

after cloning is done  you just need to run yt-dl_portable.bat
